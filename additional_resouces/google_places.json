I was told I couldn’t be there and had to walk a half a mile to the Googleplex. I asked if they could give me a ride. No.\n\nBefore I left, after I called them names for being so rude to me, I walked to the Googleplex store, I looked at some products and then a man came up to me and asked me to leave because I caused a disturbance. So I left and in the way out, gave a dog treat to a man with a dog. Then I went pee in their public bathroom which smelled terrible. I then walked back to my car through the same way I just came and 3 security guards approached me, told me I was trespassing and that they would call the police. They then walked right next to me the whole time intimidating me while I then started screaming obscenities at them because Google is a bunch of holier-than-though, velvet rope scumbags.\n\nYou can see my encounter online on my social media websites. They were out of line and I will never return. Ever.\n\nGoogle is no Apple and those people are a bunch of sadistic psychopaths who told me to leave for causing “a disruption.” First of all, I didn’t cause a disruption UNTIL you told me to leave when I was trying to give you money for your inferior products.
